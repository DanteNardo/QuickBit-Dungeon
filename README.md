# QuickBit Dungeon 

The project is made in Visual Studio 2017 using MonoGame 3.6.0

## 2D ASCII Rogue-Like
I made this game because I loved old pc rogue-likes. I loved their ASCII art, difficult gameplay, and intriguing dungeons. I wanted to make a rogue-like and I decided to use the framework I had been taught recently in school to do it. I was the sole developer of this game.
